### 📍 Global Digital Address — 2m Precision, Universal Location Encoding

**Global Digital Address (GDA)** is a simple yet powerful open-source system that converts any location on Earth into a **compact, human-readable alphanumeric code** — called a **DigiPin** — with precision up to **~2 m × 2 m**. It enables **globally unique, language-neutral, and offline-resolvable** addresses that work seamlessly for logistics, e-commerce, mapping, navigation, disaster response, and location-based services.

Instead of relying on long latitude-longitude coordinates or inconsistent street addresses, GDA encodes every square meter of the planet into a short, stable code (e.g., `XA4Z-M2K8-23`) that can be **generated, decoded, stored, and shared easily across devices and platforms**.

### ✨ Key Features

* 🌍 **Global coverage:** Works for every point on Earth — land, sea, or air.
* 📏 **High precision:** ~2 m resolution per grid cell.
* 🧠 **Compact & human-readable:** Short, alphanumeric codes optimized for sharing and memory.
* 🔁 **Bidirectional conversion:** Convert coordinates ↔ DigiPin with simple functions.
* 🧰 **Offline-friendly:** Works without network connectivity — perfect for embedded and edge devices.
* 🔑 **Deterministic & reversible:** Same coordinates always produce the same DigiPin.
* 🛠️ **Language-neutral & API-ready:** Works across platforms and languages.

### 🚀 Use Cases

* 📦 **E-commerce & delivery:** Assign precise addresses to every doorstep, even where no street names exist.
* 🗺️ **Navigation & mapping:** Compact location identifiers for offline maps and lightweight apps.
* 🆘 **Disaster relief & emergency response:** Locate individuals and resources quickly, even in unmapped areas.
* 📡 **IoT & drones:** Lightweight geocoding for sensors and autonomous systems.
* 📝 **Mapping & geocoding:** Encode every street address into a unique code.
* 📈 **Logistics & supply chain:** Track products and inventory across the globe.
* 📊 **Analytics & visualization:** Visualize data on a map or in a spreadsheet.
